<h2>The company</h2>
<div>
<p>More than 25 years ago, Maria Parker and John Parker created the Parker firm. Soon the firm grew to become the most prestigious and important real estate agency in Ireland.</p>

<p>A few years later, Jos√© Gonzalez and Matthew Byrne joined the board. The arrival of this new generation brought a new vision of the real estate business, maintaining the same principles of its founding stage.</p>

<p>Today, as at every point in our history, the Parker way remains synonymous with professionalism and efficiency when buying, selling or renting properties.</p>

<p>To this we add our activity as developers of buildings and single-family properties, turning our knowledge of the real estate market and the expectations of our clients.</p>

<p>We continue to grow, marketing properties not only in Ireland but also in the rest of Europe. We bet on the future, taking advantage of the latest and most innovative resources for the communication of commercialized properties, maintaining our values: truth, good service and customer loyalty as a badge. So that Parker Real Estate is ALWAYS the company that helps you to finalize your real estate operation.</p>
